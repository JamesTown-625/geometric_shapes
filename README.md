The purpose of this project was to learn the python turtle library. I like playing 
Dungeons and Dragons so I decided to draw my geometric shapes after the dice that 
are in the game. This project got me interested in making a dungeons and dragons
app that I could use and share with the group I play with in the future. 

Run the file from the command line with "python geometric_shapes.py" and turtle
will open a new window and start drawing the different shapes. Click on the new
window to close the app and stop the file from running.
