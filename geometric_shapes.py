Project 2: Geometric Shapes - Dungeon's and Dragons Dice
Due Date: 9/22/2018
No help was used while writing this code

Use the turtle module to draw five different geometric shapes that you choose:
Major steps:
0. import turtle module
1. Intantiate the window object with the turtle.Screen() function.
2. Create 5 different turtles to draw five different geometric shapes.
3. Move each turtle to different areas of the screen before starting.
4. Go through individually to have each turtle draw their shape one at a time. 
5. Create a multidimensional Array for each turtle for the for loop to loop through to get different coordinates and colors to fill 
    the surface of each facet on the dice. 
6. Close the window object when user clicks on the screen.

Bullet Points and Lessons Learned:
0. I have some Dungeon and Dragon dice that I looked at while writing this code to see their shapes. 
1. I used the formula ((n-2)*180Â°)/n = interior angle in degrees to know how much to turn the turtles in the for loops
2. I needed to draw the outer geometric shape first and use .write() function to get all the coordinates for the boundary to draw with.
3. Next I drew the inner geometric shape to get the coordinates of each corner 
4. Sometimes I needed to use a little geometry to make the process go a little faster but mostly I was able to just use goto() function
    to move the turtles and draw a line between the corners of the inner and outer geometric shapes. 
5. I found that it was clearer in my head to keep all the coordinates in one place for the multidimensional arrays and loop through them
    for each surface so that I could keep it organized while I wrote the code. It seemed to make for less code to me.
